## The most interesting thing I learnt about finance this week was **Credit Cards**
Credit cards are basically a means provided by the bank so that we can buy things instantly without having to pay it from our pockets at that time. Usually, we have to payback the balance on a monthly basis.
However, not everyone can get a credit card. To get one, we must maintain a good credit score. A credit score is a parameter that banks check while giving out credit to people. It tells the record of the person
with his/her previous credit borrowings. The range of credit score lies between 300 to 900. A score above 650 is usually considered good and a score lying below 550 is regarded as poor.

### Where does the bank earn from the credit cards ?
There is an initial fees you pay while getting your credit card. Whenever you make a cash withdrawal from your credit card, a small charge **(2.5-3%)** is applied on the withdrawal amount.
There are also annual credit card charges which could be waived off if you reach a certain credit card spending. Then, when you make a transaction using the credit card at a shop, the merchant 
also has to pay a charge **(1.5-3%)** to the bank. If a person fails to pay the bill at the end of the month, the bank charges a very heavy interest rate on this going as high as 30%. That's why is always wise
to pay your bills on time.

### How do I see this knowledge applying to my life ?
Credit card offer many advantages. For example, certain kinds of credit cards offer airport lounge facilities. This is very helpful for my long layovers. 
They also give other reward points which can be used for buying vouchers of different brands.
