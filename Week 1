The most interesting thing I learnt about finance this week was Credit Cards.
Credit cards are basically a means provided by the bank so that we can buy things instantly without having to pay it from our pockets at that time. Usually, we have to payback the balance on a monthly basis.
However, not everyone can get a credit card. To get one, we must maintain a good credit score. A credit score is a parameter that baks check while giving out credit to people. It tells the record of the person
with his/her previous credit borrowings. The range of credit score lies between 300 to 900. A score above 650 is usually considered good as a score lying below 550 is regarded as poor.
Now, suppose a person has a credit card. But they fail to pay the bill at the end of the month. Now, the bank charges a very heavy interest rate on this going as high as 30%. That's why is always wise
to pay your bills on time. 

Where else does the bank earn from the credit cards ?
